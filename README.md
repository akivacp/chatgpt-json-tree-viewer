# ChatGPT JSON Tree Viewer

**A simple, client-side HTML viewer for exploring and visualizing ChatGPT conversation exports in a tree format.**

This project allows you to visualize exported JSON data from ChatGPT conversations in an interactive, tree-based format. The viewer helps you navigate and understand the hierarchical structure of conversation data easily, offering a user-friendly interface for both developers and non-technical users.

## Features

- **Interactive Tree View**: Explore JSON data as a navigable tree, zooming and panning through conversation data.
- **Multiple Viewing Modes**: View your data in various formats including markdown, raw JSON, rendered HTML, and more.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly search through large conversation datasets.
- **Export Options**: Export conversation content in markdown, HTML, or raw JSON format.
- **Client-Side Only**: No server required! All processing happens directly in your browser.

## Exporting JSON Files

To use this viewer, you'll need to export your ChatGPT conversations as JSON files. One tool I recommend for this is the [ChatGPT Exporter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/456055-chatgpt-exporter), which is available on GreasyFork.

This tool is my personal favorite and works seamlessly with this viewer. However, you're free to use any tool that generates a compatible JSON file!
